Generate a brief commit message with up to the point body

Follow these steps:
1. Run `git status` to see changed files
2. Run `git diff --cached` for staged changes
3. Run `git diff` for unstaged changes
4. Analyze the changes and identify:
   - Features added/modified
   - Services affected
   - New files created
   - Dependencies updated
5. Generate commit message in conventional commits format:
   - Subject: `type(scope): brief description`
   - Body: Bullet points for each change
6. Provide the git commit command using the `git cm` alias
